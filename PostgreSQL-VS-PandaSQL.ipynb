    "Have you ever wondered how data professionals use SQL to solve real-world business problems, like generating rankings, calculating moving averages and running totals, deduplicating data, or performing time intelligence? If you already know how to select, filter, order, join and group data with SQL, this course is your next step. By the end, you will be writing queries like a pro! You will learn how to create queries for analytics and data engineering with window functions, the SQL secret weapon! Using flights data, you will discover how simple it is to use window functions, and how flexible and efficient they are."
